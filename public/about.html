<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey, I'm Srujan, a first-year student at NITK Surathkal, diving into the world of Information Technology. My passion lies in coding and web development. Outside the tech zone, I'm a sports enthusiastâ€”badminton, kabaddi, and table tennis are my games. Also, I'm into NCC, embracing discipline and leadership. Looking forward, I'm excited about collaborative full-stack web development. That's where I see myself making a mark in the tech landscape.
